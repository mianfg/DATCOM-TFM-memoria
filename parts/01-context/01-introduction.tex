\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

This work addresses two interconnected challenges in industrial systems: automated rule extraction for plant condition monitoring and survival prediction for equipment reliability.

\section{Motivation}

Modern industrial facilities rely on complex sensor networks and monitoring systems to ensure safe and efficient operations. However, translating technical documentation, Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P\&IDs), and sensor specifications into actionable monitoring rules typically requires significant manual effort from domain experts. Similarly, predicting equipment failures and remaining useful life is crucial for maintenance planning but remains challenging with traditional statistical approaches.

\section{Objectives}

The primary objectives of this work are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To develop automated methods for generating condition monitoring rules from industrial documentation using Large Language Models
    \item To improve survival prediction models for equipment reliability using deep learning techniques
    \item To validate these approaches in real-world industrial settings
\end{enumerate}

\section{Document structure}

This document is organized as follows: \Cref{ch:state-of-the-art} reviews the current state of the art in rule generation and survival prediction. \Cref{part:rule-extraction} presents the methodology and implementation for automated rule extraction. Finally, we discuss results, limitations, and future work.
