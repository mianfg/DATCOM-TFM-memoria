\chapter{Problem statement}\label{ch:problem-statement}

\section{Overview}

The challenge is to automatically generate monitoring rules that can detect abnormal conditions in industrial plants. These rules must be derived from heterogeneous sources including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sensor functional descriptions
    \item Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P\&IDs)
    \item Technical documentation and manuals
    \item Historical maintenance records
\end{itemize}

\section{Input data}

\subsection{Sensor specifications}

Sensor documentation typically includes information about measurement range, accuracy, response time, and intended operating conditions.

\subsection{P\&ID diagrams}

P\&IDs provide visual representations of the process flow, equipment connections, and instrumentation layout. Extracting semantic information from these diagrams requires both image processing and domain knowledge.

\subsection{Domain knowledge}

Expert knowledge about normal operating conditions, safety constraints, and process relationships is often implicit in documentation and must be elicited.

\section{Expected outputs}

The system should generate rules in a format suitable for condition monitoring systems. These rules should:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Be interpretable by human operators
    \item Capture both simple threshold violations and complex multi-sensor relationships
    \item Include confidence scores or uncertainty estimates
    \item Be validated against known operational scenarios
\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges}

Key challenges include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data heterogeneity:} Combining structured and unstructured data sources
    \item \textbf{Domain specificity:} Different plants have unique configurations and requirements
    \item \textbf{Validation:} Ensuring generated rules are correct and safe
    \item \textbf{Hallucination:} Preventing LLMs from generating plausible but incorrect rules
    \item \textbf{Explainability:} Understanding how rules were derived for operator trust
\end{itemize}
