\chapter{Background and State of the Art}\label{background-and-state-of-the-art}

\section{Anomaly Detection in Industrial Processes}\label{anomaly-detection-in-industrial-processes}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Traditional, data-driven approaches (statistical, ML-based)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Popular, but lacks interpretability and requires massive historical
    failure data (which is rare in safe plants)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Rule extraction-based approaches (knowledge-driven) instead of
  statistical/ML: generate explainable rules

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Role of domain knowledge
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Gap}: Automated rule extraction from documentation
\end{itemize}

\section{Knowledge Extraction (IE)}\label{knowledge-extraction-ie}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Traditional ML-based approach for knowledge extraction: ontology
  learning, relation extraction
\item
  Limitations for complex rule extraction

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Traditional NLP (spacy, regex) fails on nested logic and implicit
    content
  \item
    Current IE systems extract facts (Subject-Predicate-Object), but
    rarely extract procedures or executable logic (If-Then-Else), or too
    strict
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{LLM-based Rule Generation}\label{llm-based-rule-generation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Why LLMs are ideal in this use case (multiple research papers showing
  comparison and results)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Versatile reasoning and generalization
  \item
    Contextual understanding
  \item
    Code generation
  \item
    Automation and control
  \end{itemize}
\item
  LLM techniques normally used in this context
\item
  State of the art in information extraction (structured information
  from scientific papers, industrial documents\ldots)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Code-as-Policy literature
  \end{itemize}
\item
  State of the art in rule generation. Show existing approaches and its
  limitations
\item
  Positioning: apply Code-as-Policy to industrial process domain
\end{itemize}
