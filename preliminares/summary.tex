\chapter{Summary}

\emph{Brief summary of problem, approach, contributions, and results}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ensure the abstract follows a strict ``narrative arc'': Context (1
  sentence) \(\to\) Gap (1 sentence) \(\to\) Hypothesis/Method (2
  sentences) \(\to\) Results (quantified) \(\to\) Impact.
\item
  ``We propose a multi-stage semantic compilation framework that treats
  natural language specifications as source code, formalized into
  executable rules and deployed on a lightweight streaming engine.''
\item
  Quantify: Mention the exact metric improvement if possible (e.g.,
  consolidation ratio, \% valid rules)
\item
  Application in industrial contexts: ``Validation on a streaming
  runtime demonstrates that the extracted rules can be evaluated in
  \(O(1)\) time using incremental statistics, confirming suitability for
  high-frequency industrial edge deployment''
\end{itemize}
